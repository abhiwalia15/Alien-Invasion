# Alien-Invasion
My first game written in python language using pygame.
In alien invasion the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom centre of the screen.The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.When the game begins,a fleet of aliens fill the sky and moves across and down the screen.The player shoots and destroy the aliens.If the player shoots all the aliens , a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet.If any player hits the aliens fleet of aliens hit the players ship or reaches the bottom of the screen ,the player looses a ship(life).If the player looses all of his 3 ships he looses the game and game ends.
enjoy :-)
